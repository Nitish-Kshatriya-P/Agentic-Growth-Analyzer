Agentic Growth Hub Dashboard

Overview
A Tableau dashboard I developed to showcase the impact of the Agentic Platform on e-commerce customer behavior. This project analyzes synthetic e-commerce data to demonstrate how the platform enhances sales, customer engagement, and profitability. The dashboard features interactive visualizations—bar charts, line charts, and pie charts—built using Tableau Public, with data generated via Python.


Purpose
The Agentic Platform is a hypothetical tool designed to boost e-commerce performance. I built this dashboard to:
- Quantify the increase in average orders per customer.
- Measure the growth in brand diversity (cross-selling).
- Highlight the rise in high-value VIP customer segments.
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for retail stakeholders, proving the platform’s value through data-driven insights.

Features
- Bar Chart: Displays the average orders per customer (Before: 3.16, After: 4.76), showing a 50.6% growth.
- Line Chart: Tracks the average brands bought per customer (Before: 2.5, After: 3.85), a 1.5x increase.
- Pie Charts: Compares customer segment distributions (Before: 7% VIP, After: 10% VIP), a 1.42x VIP growth factor.
- Key Metrics: Highlights order growth (50.6%), brand diversity (1.5x), and VIP growth (1.42x).
